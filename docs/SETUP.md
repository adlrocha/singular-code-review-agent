# Setup Guide — Running Your Own Code Review Bot

This guide takes you from a fork of `singular-code-review-agent` to a fully
working **automated pull-request reviewer that runs as your own GitHub App
identity**, on your own repos, with your own image.

It is written for the **fork-and-configure** workflow: the agent source stays in
sync with upstream (Singular), and _all_ bot identity is driven by repository
variables and secrets — so you can pull downstream changes without editing
hard-coded values.

---

## How this fork stays independent (design overview)

Upstream hard-codes three identity values. This fork keeps those values as
**defaults** and makes them **overridable at runtime** through repo variables /
env vars:

| What                     | Where upstream hard-codes it               | How you override it (no source edit)      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| App Client ID            | `.github/workflows/review.yml`             | repo variable **`REVIEW_APP_CLIENT_ID`**  |
| Command trigger (`@bot`) | `src/review/types.ts` (guard)              | repo variable **`REVIEW_COMMAND`**        |
| Bot login (`name[bot]`)  | `src/review/types.ts`                      | **automatic** — derived from the App slug |
| Reviewer image           | `.github/workflows/review.yml`             | repo variable **`REVIEW_IMAGE`**          |
| App private key          | `secrets.SINGULAR_CODE_REVIEW_PRIVATE_KEY` | Actions **secret**                        |
| OpenCode API key         | `secrets.OPENCODE_API_KEY`                 | Actions **secret**                        |

Because the defaults still match upstream, merging upstream changes into your
fork produces **no conflicts on identity lines** — your identity lives entirely
in variables/secrets, not in the source. Cosmetic strings (log prefixes like
`[singular-code-review]`, internal paths like `/tmp/.singular-code-review`) are
left as upstream on purpose; they don't affect the bot's identity and renaming
them only creates merge friction. See [Full rebrand](#full-rebrand-optional) for
when you eventually stop tracking upstream.

> **Note on the secret name:** the secret is still called
> `SINGULAR_CODE_REVIEW_PRIVATE_KEY` to avoid churn in the reusable workflow's
> `workflow_call` interface. It is just a label — it holds _your_ App's key. You
> can rename it in one pass later (see [Full rebrand](#full-rebrand-optional)).

---

## Prerequisites

- A fork of this repo pushed to your GitHub account/org (e.g. `you/code-review-agent`).
- The [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated:
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```
- An **OpenCode Go API key** (the reviewer backend). You provide this; the
  runner reads it from `OPENCODE_API_KEY`.
- (Optional) A **Context7 API key** for higher rate limits.

---

## Step 1 — Create your GitHub App

`gh` cannot create Apps, so this one step is manual. Everything after it is
automated by `scripts/setup-review-bot.sh`.

**Easiest:** run the helper that prints exact click-by-click instructions:

```bash
scripts/setup-review-bot.sh create-app           # personal app
scripts/setup-review-bot.sh create-app --org NAME # org app
```

**Summary of what the App needs:**

- **Repository permissions:** `Contents: Read-only`, `Issues: Read & write`,
  `Pull requests: Read & write`, `Metadata: Read-only`.
  Do **not** grant Administration or `Contents: write`.
- **Subscribe to events:** `Pull request`, `Issue comment`.
- **Webhook:** leave **Active unchecked** — the workflow is event-driven; the App
  never receives webhooks.
- **Install scope:** "Only on this account" for personal use, or "Any account"
  if other orgs will install it.

After creating the App:

1. On the App's **General** page, copy the **Client ID** (starts with `Iv`).
2. Under **Private keys → Generate a private key** — a `*.pem` downloads. Keep it
   safe; you'll feed it to the setup script.

---

## Step 2 — Install the App

On the App page, click **Install App** and install it on:

- the repos you want reviewed, **and**
- the repo that _runs_ the review workflow (usually the same repos).

For an org, pick "Selected repositories" (recommended) or "All repositories".

---

## Step 3 — Publish the reviewer image (your fork)

Your fork already publishes to its **own** GHCR namespace automatically —
`.github/workflows/publish-image.yml` uses `ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}` with no
hard-coded owner. So once you push to `main` (or tag a release), the image is
published as:

```
ghcr.io/<your-user-or-org>/<your-agent-repo>:latest
ghcr.io/<your-user-or-org>/<your-agent-repo>:sha-<commit>
```

Verify after a push:

```bash
gh api /users/<you>/packages/container/<your-agent-repo>
```

> **Keep the package public** (the GHCR default). If you make it private, the
> reusable workflow can't pull it without extra configuration — see
> [Private images](#private-images-optional) below.

---

## Step 4 — Configure a repository to receive reviews

From inside a checkout of the repo you want reviewed, run the setup script. It
sets the secrets + variables and writes the consumer trigger workflow:

```bash
cd path/to/repo-i-want-reviewed

/path/to/code-review-agent/scripts/setup-review-bot.sh configure \
  --repo YOU/REPO-I-WANT-REVIEWED \
  --app-client-id Iv1...                                  `# from Step 1` \
  --private-key ~/Downloads/your-app.private-key.pem      `# from Step 1` \
  --opencode-key "$OPENCODE_API_KEY"                       `# your OpenCode Go key` \
  --command '@your-bot'                                    `# optional; default @singular-code-review` \
  --image ghcr.io/you/code-review-agent:latest             `# optional; from Step 3` \
  --agent-repo you/code-review-agent                       `# the repo that owns review.yml`
```

Then commit the generated workflow:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/code-review.yml
git commit -m "ci: add code review bot"
git push
```

The script:

- sets secrets `SINGULAR_CODE_REVIEW_PRIVATE_KEY`, `OPENCODE_API_KEY`
  (and `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` if `--context7-key` is given),
- sets variables `REVIEW_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `REVIEW_COMMAND`, and `REVIEW_IMAGE`
  (only when non-default),
- writes `.github/workflows/code-review.yml` with the correct `uses:` line and
  command.

**Preview without changing anything** with `--dry-run`. **Skip the workflow
file** with `--no-workflow`. See all options:

```bash
scripts/setup-review-bot.sh configure --help
```

---

## Step 5 — (Optional) Make the agent repo review itself

Run Step 4 against the agent fork too (`--repo you/code-review-agent`). This lets
the bot review PRs on the agent repo itself, which is how upstream operates.

---

## Step 6 — Trigger a review and verify

Open a **non-draft, same-repo** pull request, or have an `OWNER` / `MEMBER` /
`COLLABORATOR` comment **`@your-bot`** on a same-repo PR. (Use the exact string
you passed to `--command`.)

To verify the configuration is complete without opening a PR:

```bash
scripts/setup-review-bot.sh check --repo YOU/REPO
```

To run a review **manually** for testing: GitHub → Actions → "Code Review" →
Run workflow → enter a PR number.

To **skip** a review on a specific PR: start the title with `[skip]`, or add a
line `<your-command> skip` to the PR body.

## Reference: variables & secrets

### Required

| Type     | Name                               | Purpose                                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| secret   | `SINGULAR_CODE_REVIEW_PRIVATE_KEY` | Your App's private key (mints the installation token) |
| secret   | `OPENCODE_API_KEY`                 | OpenCode Go API key                                   |
| variable | `REVIEW_APP_CLIENT_ID`             | Your App's Client ID                                  |
| variable | `REVIEW_COMMAND`                   | Trigger string (e.g. `@your-bot`)                     |

### Optional

| Type     | Name                  | Purpose                                              |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| secret   | `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`    | Higher rate limits                                   |
| variable | `REVIEW_IMAGE`        | Reviewer image (defaults to upstream's)              |
| variable | `OPENCODE_MODEL`      | Review model (default `opencode-go/minimax-m2.7`)    |
| variable | `OPENCODE_GATE_MODEL` | Gate model (default `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash`) |

### Manual equivalents (no script)

```bash
# secrets (repo-level)
gh secret set --repo YOU/REPO SINGULAR_CODE_REVIEW_PRIVATE_KEY < app-private-key.pem
gh secret set --repo YOU/REPO OPENCODE_API_KEY --body "$OPENCODE_API_KEY"
gh secret set --repo YOU/REPO CONTEXT7_API_KEY --body "$CONTEXT7_API_KEY"   # optional

# variables (repo-level)
gh variable set --repo YOU/REPO REVIEW_APP_CLIENT_ID --body "Iv1..."
gh variable set --repo YOU/REPO REVIEW_COMMAND       --body "@your-bot"
gh variable set --repo YOU/REPO REVIEW_IMAGE         --body "ghcr.io/you/code-review-agent:latest"
```

For many repos, prefer **organization** secrets/variables scoped to the selected
repos (the script supports this with `--org ORG --org-repos "a,b"`).

---

## Private images (optional)

The reusable workflow pulls the image at the `container:` level. A **public**
GHCR package needs no extra setup. If you make the package private, the consuming
workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` must be able to read it; add `packages: read` to the
permissions block of **both** the reusable workflow (`.github/workflows/review.yml`)
and the consumer trigger workflow, and ensure the package's access settings grant
the consuming repo's token. Keeping the image public is strongly recommended.

---

## Keeping your fork in sync with upstream

Because all identity is config-driven, syncing is just a normal merge/rebase:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/we-are-singular/singular-code-review-agent.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main      # or: git rebase upstream/main
# resolve any conflicts (expected only where upstream touched the small
# parameterization lines you added) and push
git push
```

Pushing to `main` republishes your image (Step 3).

---

## Full rebrand (optional)

When you eventually **stop** tracking upstream and want zero "Singular" branding,
do a one-time sweep. The values you can safely rename/repoint:

- Secret `SINGULAR_CODE_REVIEW_PRIVATE_KEY` → e.g. `REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
  (update `.github/workflows/review.yml` `workflow_call.secrets`, the consumer
  workflow's `secrets:` block, `scripts/setup-review-bot.sh`, and this doc).
- Env var `SINGULAR_CODE_REVIEW_INSTALL_DEPS` (in `.github/workflows/review.yml`
  and `bin/provision.sh`).
- Log prefix `[singular-code-review]` in `src/cli/review-guard.ts`,
  `src/cli/review-ack.ts`, `src/lib/logger.ts`, `bin/provision.sh`,
  `bin/review_dry_run`.
- Internal paths `/tmp/.singular-code-review`, `/usr/local/lib/singular-code-review`,
  `/usr/local/share/singular-code-review` (in `src/config/paths.ts`, `Dockerfile`,
  `bin/*`, `opencode/opencode.json`, and the packaging test assertions).
- Package `userAgent` in `src/clients/github.ts`.

These are cosmetic and have no effect on the bot's identity, so you can defer
them indefinitely while you still merge from upstream.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot never triggers:** run `scripts/setup-review-bot.sh check --repo YOU/REPO`.
  Ensure the PR is non-draft and from the **same repo** (fork PRs are blocked by
  design), and that a human OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR issued the mention.
- **`permission denied` / `Resource not accessible by integration`:** the App
  lacks a permission (check Contents/Issues/Pull requests in Step 1) or isn't
  installed on the repo.
- **Image pull fails:** the package is private. See
  [Private images](#private-images-optional).
- **`@your-bot` is ignored but `@singular-code-review` works:** you forgot to set
  `REVIEW_COMMAND` to your command (or used a different string in the trigger
  workflow's `if:` block). They must match exactly.
- **Reviews post as the wrong name:** the bot login is derived automatically from
  the App slug. To change the name, rename the App in its settings.
